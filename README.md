# northwestern-proxy-for-arc
This repository contains a custom extension to load the Northwestern University VPN bookmarklet button. It is intended for the Arc browser since it handles bookmarks differently, preventing the usual method of adding a bookmarklet. It should work on other browsers, but I have not tested it outside of Arc.
